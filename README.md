# Memorability - Third year University project

A project supervised by Dr. Adrian Bors, Titled "Computer Learning of what is Memorable from Images", where I explored the use of CNNs to predict the most and least memorable regions of images.

I explored several deep learning techniques and settled on Transfer Learning, which I implemented in PyTorch.

This project allowed me to generate Visual Memory Schema (VMS) like the following, which show the most memorable regions of images.
